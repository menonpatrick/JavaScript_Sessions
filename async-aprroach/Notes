Synchronous Approach:

Sync Code is executed in sequence.
Each statement waits for the previous statement to finish before executing.

Asynchronous code doesn't have to wait.
Although, your program can continue to run.
It helpsin reducing the waiting time for the user.

    1. Callback
    2. Promises
    3. asycn/await
